		<h2><u><li>JAVA PROGRAMING OF THE SYSTEM</li></u></h2>
		
		<ul type="square"><h3><u><i><li>Description</li></i></u></h3>
			<ol><li><b>INTRODUCTION</b></li>

<P>In this chapter I will be describing how powerful general purpose programming language was used to create the analyzed system. Under this chapter I will undergo full detail of how everything will function together with database that have been describe above and how it cope with full analyzed system. </P>
<P>3.2 Tools used to develop this system in java programming: <P>
<P>Eclipse IDE: an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development, and, until 2016, was the most popular. <P>


			              <h3><u><i><li>Forms and Images</li></i></u></h3>
        </ul>
		
		                <ol><b>Welcoming page</b></li>
		                <p>this was the first page of the system where system will choose destination depending on the function he/she possess in the organization where he need to log in. if he has not  account he may create it and comes as signup form</p>
<img src="01.png" width=200 height=200><br>
<p>if he don’t has account he receive this signup form reveal like this</p>
<img src="02.png" width=400 height=200><br><br>
<b> Administrator homepage</i><b>
<p>With this page administrator will be informed what tasks can system administrator do in this system. like adding new account holders for those who need the service of organization. This menu also indicates what field an administrator should manipulates 
whether he required to fill other tables in database this is where the actions should be indicated.</p>
<img src="03.png" width=400 height=200><br>
<p>When you tap on taskbar it provides the to the administrator a form he needs on these form is where view ,delete, update, and insert</p>
<b> ACCOUNTS FORM</i><b>
	<p>when admin press on accounts taskbar it provides this form and on that form it is where CRUD illustrated</p>

	<b> conclusion</i><b><b>
		
<p>By concluding this chapter concerns with java programming especially in my developed system, we can say that I have final product that I was expecting to have it, the
manipulation of data is going well the design is there with special appearance ,but there
much to go on and that need to be improved will be gained from external view apart from system developers
